What Gri is
===========

Gri is a language for scientific graphics applications.  By 'language'
I mean that it is a command-driven application, as opposed to a
click/point application.  It is analogous to latex or tex, and shares
the property that extensive power is the reward for tolerating a
learning curve.  Gri output is in PostScript, suitable for 
incorporation in documents prepared by various text processors.

Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
Control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
line widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
language for letters and mathematical symbols in labels.


Compiling and Installing Gri
============================
 
The normal case is to have received the Gri source as a so-called
"tarball".  If that is how you got Gri, then you should type
	./configure
	make
	make install
at the shell to create and install Gri.  If there is a problem in these
steps, trying typing
	aclocal
	autoconf
	automake --add-missing
first to create some configuration files, and then you type
	./configure
	make
	make install
as usual.
