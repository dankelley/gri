If you are reading this file, it means you are trying to build and
install Gri.  The method for this depends on how you got the Gri
source.

CASE 1
------

If the gri source is a "tarball" from http://gri.sourceforge.net (or
another source), do as follows.
::

    ./configure
     make
    make check
    make install

If you wish to control the location in which Gri is installed, use a
"prefix" command at the configure stage, e.g.
::

    ./configure --prefix=/opt

There are also some special flags; read the ``configure.ac`` file to
learn about them.  One that the author is working on lately is
exemplified
::

    --enable-OSX_BUNDLE

which is used to cause Gri to look for gri.cmd in the same directory
as the executable, which is useful in an OSX bundle application.


CASE 2
------

If the gri source is from the "git" server at
http://github.com/dankelley/gri, do
::

        automake
        autoconf

to create the ``configure`` file, and then follow the same procedure
as in Case 1.
